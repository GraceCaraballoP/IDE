Eclipse is one of the most popular open source IDEs. It is usually used for Java based applications, it is also used for C/C++, PHP and Perl and other web projects.

## Installation
To start with the installation of Eclipse through the terminal we must verify that we have Java installed. We will do this by typing the following in the terminal:
```
java –version
```

Once verified that we have Java installed. We will use the Snap packages for the installation, they are packages that make the installation process smooth and without errors.

```
sudo snap install --classic eclipse
```
