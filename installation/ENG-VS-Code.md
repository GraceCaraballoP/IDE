Visual Studio Code is a cross-platform IDE. Like Eclipse, it is also designed to be able to work with applications such as Java, C / C++, PHP, CSS, among others.

## Installation

To start with the installation of Visual Studio Code through the terminal we must verify that we have Java installed. We will do this by typing the following in the terminal:
```
java –version
```

Once verified that we have Java installed. We will use the Snap packages for the installation, they are packages that make the installation process smooth and without errors.
```
sudo snap install --classic code
```

Once this is done, it is ready to be used and we will see something similar or equal to this, although this will depend on the version.
