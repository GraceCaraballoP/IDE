Intellij IDEA is an open source IDE for developing Java applications. According to surveys, Java developers prefer Intellij over other IDEs like Eclipse.

## Installation

To start with the installation of Intellij through the terminal we must verify that we have Java installed. We will do this by typing the following in the terminal:
```
java –version
```

```

```
